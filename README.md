# Comparing-Many-Numbers
Write a list management program. You should use functions for most of these operations.
1. Create a program to generate 20 random numbers from 0 to 99 and store them in a
list.
2. Locate second largest and second smallest numbers.
Now modify your program to determine the second largest and the second smallest
number in the list and output your results.
3. Now modify your program to create a list of 20 random numbers, output the list, and
then remove all entries greater than the third highest number in your list and output
the resulting list after this operation.
4. Re-organise list data Create a program to generate a new list of 20 random numbers
from 0 to 99.
5. Insert number 50 in the middle position of the list. All numbers in the first half of the
list that are greater than 50 should be removed from the first half and appended to
the second half.
6. Then do the same with all numbers in the second half of the list that are smaller than
50, appending them to the end of the first half of the list before the number 50.
